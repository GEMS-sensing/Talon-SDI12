# Talon-SDI12
Talon daughterboard for [Flight data logger](https://github.com/GEMS-sensing/DFM_-_Flight?tab=readme-ov-file). Designed to interface with [Kestrel](https://github.com/GEMS-sensing/Project-Kestrel) main board. This board is designed to provide data logger with support to interface with [SDI-12 communication standard](https://www.sdi-12.org/current_specification/SDI-12%20Specification%201.4%20February%2020%202023.pdf) for environmental sensors.

<!-- ## Version History

`v0.0` - Initial primal version with screw terminal

`v0.1` - Initial 'hard mount' version, using M12 connector

`v1.0` - Removed pullup select[^3], added logic level buffer and voltage reg on input

`v1.1` - Moved via away from connector pads to prevent bridging when soldering 

`v2.0` - Fixed issue with address select jumper[^3] -->

<!-- ## Jumper Settings 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Jumper settings valid for version `v2.0` and beyond[^3]

## Known Issues/Errata

None
<!-- #### Solder Jumper Stencil

**Version Affected:** All

**Issue:** Solar input does not support very low impedance sources (e.g. lead acid battery) - see details in issue [#20](https://github.com/GEMS-sensing/Project-Kestrel/issues/20)

**Workaround:** 

* Avoid use of low impedance batteries for input
* Include series impedance to prevent current spikes (not desirable)
* Perform board patch described in issue [#20](https://github.com/GEMS-sensing/Project-Kestrel/issues/20) -->
